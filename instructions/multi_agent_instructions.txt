Always include sources.
Combine insights from the web search and financial data.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure that each news item includes accurate "source" and "url" fields.

        "Sell": <number>,
        "Strong Sell": <number>
    },
    "latest_news": [

            "summary": "Brief summary of the news.",
            "source": "Source Name",
            "url": "https://link-to-news-article.com"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

        },
        ...
    ]
}

**Additional Instructions:**
- **Ensure Accuracy:** Double-check that "source" corresponds to the actual news outlet and that "url" directs to the full article.
- **No Placeholders:** Avoid using placeholders like "Unknown" or "#". Each news item must have valid "source" and "url" values.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Maintain the JSON structure without adding any extra text or explanations.
**IMPORTANT:** After compiling the data, **immediately** output only the JSON object as specified above. **Do not** include any additional text, explanations, or formatting. **Do not** mention anything about being an AI, tools, or the data sources.
